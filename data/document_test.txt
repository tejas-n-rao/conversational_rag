MAJOR IN DATA SCIENCE

Introduction to the Major in Data Science

The undergraduate program in Data Science is intended to be a rigorous program with an interdisciplinary flavor. The program builds on the mathematical foundations of computing complemented by hands-on experience through project work mentored by faculty to address some of the key problems in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), computational and data Sciences with applications in computational sciences, computer vision, digital agriculture, econometrics, e-commerce, environmental studies, finance, medical imaging, supply chain management, etc. 

This program equips students with the requisite skills to effectively analyze the growing amount of data and its complexity and develop tools and services to support strategic and tactical decision-making.  The courses are primarily project-based and provide students with opportunities to gain hands-on experience through the analysis of real-world data sets using a variety of sophisticated tools for modelling, optimization, data mining, and visualization. This program also offers a research-based capstone experience for the students.

One of the unique components of our program is the interdisciplinary flavour where the statistical, programming, and mathematical skills learned can be applied in various social sciences fields. Numerous appealing frontiers exist at the intersection of data sciences and social sciences. Data science methods and tools can be applied to estimate the impact of an impending public policy (for example, the effect of a proposed tax hike by the Government). Similarly, data science has enormous applications in Psephology, a branch of political science. Data scientists can help decode why opinion polls for elections often fail and use machine learning algorithms to run targeted campaigns and estimate public response to political campaigns.  

The program would stand to gain immensely from other disciplines in a liberal arts school. For example, students would learn ethical principles and apply them to the responsible use of artificial intelligence technologies. Lastly, data science often requires complex decision-making regarding appropriate tools and techniques for a problem. Philosophy confers someone with the logical thinking skills required to navigate a complex problem space and arrive at what is necessary to solve the problem.


Distinguishing features of the program:

The curriculum is developed so that the students can acquire the necessary math, theoretical, and programming foundations through core courses during the first two years of the program.
The students from their third year can start taking electives that are interdisciplinary and application-oriented. Further, the program is driven by projects that help students use relevant design and development tools and techniques to solve problems by applying their theoretical and conceptual understanding gained earlier. 
The program has been designed to conceptualize data through the prism of multiple disciplines of sciences and social sciences.
The program culminates with a capstone thesis that is essentially a full-fledged project where the student in conjunction with their mentor works on a problem of sufficient scale and complexity involving a good mix of theoretical and practical knowledge by employing state-of-the-art design and analysis tools.
The following are some of the representative elective courses that this program plans to offer: Big Data Analytics, Computational Methods, Computer Vision, Data Science for Public Policy, Data Visualization, Deep Learning, Econometrics, Graph Theory, High-Performance Computation, History of Data Science, Natural Language Processing, Optimization for Data Science, Simulation and Modelling, and Supply Chain Management, Sports Data Science, Data Science for Politics and Policymaking, History of Data Science

Responsible Artificial Intelligence:
Description of the Responsible Artifical Intelligence Course: The Responsible Artifical Intelligence Course is a 4-credit course that is offered in Trimester 8. Recent advances in computing and information technologies, including hardware, software, databases, networks and communications have enabled the commercialization of many applications of Artificial Intelligence. Specifically, in the case of Supervised Learning, Deep Neural Networks and related algorithms have been able to achieve or even surpass human-like accuracy in applications like face recognition, voice recognition, automated driving, language translation, etc. This has given rise to multiple deployments of AI-based applications not only in the private sector but also in the Government. These deployments in areas such as recidivism prediction, algorithmic online ad targeting, drug addiction risk prediction, criminal intentionality detection in early stage shoplifting, etc. promise the effectiveness and efficiency of evidence-based decision-making. This early success has spurred rapid and frantic development of solutions using AI/ML and associated technologies without adequate safeguards and regulations. However, of late, multiple cases of bias and unfairness have been reported in the decisions made by AI/ML based algorithms, thus, raising ethical questions. In addition, AI/ML-based decisions cannot be explained easily due to their “black-box” nature. Impenetrability of AI/ML algorithmic decisions has reduced “trust” in the very algorithms that promised so much. This has spurred a call for Explainable AI (XAI) – AI-based decision-making that incorporates the notions of fairness, accountability and transparency.

Learning Outcomes of the Responsible Artifical Intelligence Course:: 
One of the main objectives of this course is to impart students with sufficient knowledge so that they can critically think about any AI/ML based decision-making algorithm and identify potential problem sources. The problems can then be rectified before the solution is deployed in any real-world application.

Syllabus of the Responsible Artifical Intelligence Course::

This course intends to equip the participant, the present and future managers, with an understanding of the ethical and other related dimensions in the field of algorithmic and AI/ML-based decision-making. Some of the objectives of this course include:
1. Understanding the notions of fairness, bias, accountability and trust as applicable to algorithmic decision-making.  
2. Exploring the AI/ML-based application development process
3. Understanding the sources of bias, discrimination, lack of transparency, fairness and trust in algorithms
4. Strategies to mitigate bias and unfairness in algorithms

Prerequisites for the Responsible Artifical Intelligence Course::  None
